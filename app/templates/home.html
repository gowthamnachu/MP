        <h2 class="text-light mt-5">Understanding Mathematical Progression</h2>
        <p class="text-light mt-3">
            Mathematical progressions are sequences of numbers that follow a specific pattern. They are classified into two main types: 
            arithmetic progressions (AP) and geometric progressions (GP). Understanding these progressions is crucial for solving a wide range of 
            mathematical and real-world problems. 
        </p>
        <p class="text-light">
            In an **arithmetic progression**, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. For example, the sequence 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ... 
            is an arithmetic progression where the common difference is 2. On the other hand, a **geometric progression** involves terms where 
            each term is obtained by multiplying the previous one by a constant ratio. For instance, the sequence 2, 6, 18, 54, 162, ... is a 
            geometric progression where the common ratio is 3.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="text-light mt-5">Applications of Progressions</h3>
        <p class="text-light">
            Progressions have a broad range of applications in fields like finance, physics, and computer science. For instance, in **finance**, 
            arithmetic progressions are often used in calculating loan payments or investment growth over time. Similarly, geometric progressions are 
            used in **population growth models** or **interest calculations**.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-light mt-5">Optimization and Linear Programming</h2>
        <p class="text-light">
            Linear programming (LP) is an optimization technique used to achieve the best outcome in a mathematical model whose requirements are 
            represented by linear relationships. LP is extensively used in various industries, such as supply chain management, production planning, 
            and resource allocation. The core objective of linear programming is to maximize or minimize an objective function subject to constraints.
        </p>
        <p class="text-light">
            In **linear programming**, the goal is typically to find the optimal solution to a problem, such as maximizing profits or minimizing costs, 
            under a set of linear constraints. The **graphical method** is a visual approach used for solving LP problems with two variables, whereas the 
            **Simplex method** is a more advanced algorithm for higher-dimensional problems. Both methods are effective for finding the best solution for 
            optimization problems.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-light mt-5">How Does Linear Programming Work?</h3>
        <p class="text-light">
            The general form of a linear programming problem consists of:
        </p>
        <ul class="text-light">
            <li><strong>Objective Function:</strong> A linear function that needs to be maximized or minimized, such as profit or cost.</li>
            <li><strong>Constraints:</strong> Linear equations or inequalities that restrict the possible solutions.</li>
            <li><strong>Decision Variables:</strong> The unknowns that we are solving for, typically denoted as x₁, x₂, ..., xn.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-light">
            To solve an LP problem, we first plot the constraints on a graph, identify the feasible region, and then find the optimal solution, 
            which typically occurs at one of the corner points of the feasible region.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-light mt-5">Applications of Linear Programming</h2>
        <p class="text-light">
            Linear programming is widely applied in real-world problems, including:
        </p>
        <ul class="text-light">
            <li><strong>Production Optimization:</strong> Companies use LP to determine the optimal number of units to produce to maximize profits.</li>
            <li><strong>Supply Chain Management:</strong> LP helps in determining the most cost-effective way to allocate resources across various stages.</li>
            <li><strong>Diet Problems:</strong> LP is used to find the most cost-efficient diet plan that meets nutritional requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>Transportation Problems:</strong> LP is applied to minimize transportation costs while satisfying demand and supply constraints.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-light mt-5">Why Linear Programming?</h3>
        <p class="text-light">
            Linear programming is essential because it provides a systematic and efficient way to solve complex optimization problems. The ability to 
            model real-world scenarios and obtain an optimal solution helps businesses and researchers make more informed decisions.
